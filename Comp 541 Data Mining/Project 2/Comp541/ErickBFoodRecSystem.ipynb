    "#Insights and Actionable Recomendations Cell 5 \n",
    "Key Insights: For insights the charts and graphs are the most important for findings. Such as finding what exactly is the most popular and when it is best to sell and how. Finding the most popular pizzas and toppings will also provide key insights and the visualization helps with the clarity that it provides. Although the graphs for best selling from daily, weekly, to monthly are a bit hard to read since I could not get the dates to update so they all print out monthly however enlarging and studying gives key insights into popular times for selling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable Recommendations: Given the data many actions and recommendations may be given. The sales data may give options for when to post sales, close, or order less ingredients to save money. Another recommendation may be to see the most popular ingredients and combine into new pizzas according to the data a garlic and tomatoes pizza may be popular(although in this case tomatoes may just be sauce). The sales and order by pizza may allow you to downsize the menu and with the help of the pizza by category chart allow you to create pizzas by group and find new combinations and make the menu more readable. Recommendation systems can give you a marketing strategy to release limited time pizza to keep getting return customers while also saving buying in season ingredients. Lastly finding the similarity of pizzas will allow you to remove pizzas that are too similar or maybe offer more options with pizzas that have ingredient overlap and give customers more options and thus netting a larger range of customers. ALthough personally a make you own is good for a pizza shop anyway.\n"

    "#Conclusion and Future Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: In conclusion the frindings and implications are very useful not only for buisnesses, but many other people such as investors, marketing, and providers. We were able to derive popular items and trends from the charts that could be used to save money and create more opportunites. While the charts also provide room to explore creativity in introducing new ingredients or downsizing to a more minimal approach. Pair this with the recommendation system and you will be more confident in decisions as it will backup the other fidnings while giving people ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Directions: This was really and intro to food recommendation. There are many ways to mine data. For example I used both a recommendation algorithm as well as a cosine similarity that I learned in my AI class. Many different methods can give you better insights or maybe personal preference for readings. As we learn more of the intricascies of programming languages, data mining methods, and mathematics we will improve our tools and our ability to create more findings and do it efficiently. After these findings sitting down with the owners we can find methods to increase profitability and customer happiness. For further analysis and data collection I would recommend a more experience data miner that can extarct more or learn more myself as we can build on this project personally. For further data collection studying different years or seasons as well as different pizza shops in other areas around the same city could be interesting. As well as mining geographical data to see how everything changes with populations. Really adding more variables to this data such as customer information could explore more possibilities for insights."
